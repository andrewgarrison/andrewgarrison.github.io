  		<h1> WEEK 6 - 11/8/14 </h1>
  		<p> Throughout the six weeks of class I learned a lot, but what stood out to me the most was learning about the flow of programming, JQUERY, and myself. <br>
  		<br> </p>
  		<h2>PROGRAMMING WORK FLOW</h2>
			<p>By this I mean the manner in which my coding is executed, how to write correct code, where to write code, and find errors in the code. Coming into class I used an internet based platform to write and practice code. After GET HIP I learned what type of programming editors you can use to create projects. For example i've never heard of notepad ++, or sublime text (code formatted editors), and now they are my best friend. I also learned ways to fix my code when errors occurred by inspecting the element on the webpage and checking the console. </p>

  </div>
		<div id="Query">
		<h2>JQUERY</h2>
		<p id="Queryp">My favorite programming language that we learned was JQUERY. This is because it is a much more simplified version of Javascript and makes life A LOT easier. For example in Javascript to call a out an ID or class we had to use the statement - <span style='word-wrap:break-word'>document.getElementByID("idname");</span> and in JQUERY it looks like this - $("#idname"); . As you can see from that small example that JQUERY is much more simplified, and can allow you to do much more in a less amount of time. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="Myself">
		<h2>MYSELF</h2>
		<p>Despite all of the excellent material and concepts we learned during class time, learning about myself and my strengths was my favorite part of the entire program. I think this is because I can take all of what I learned and apply it to anything I do in life and to help me grow as a person. Also our entrepreneurial strengths are key for forming teams to get work done efficiently. For example, if I ever start a business some day I can look directly at my top entrepreneurial strengths and determine what i'm good at when it comes to conducting business, and what I need help with. </p>

  		<h1> WEEK 5 - 11/1/14 </h1>
  		<p>This week we reviewed more JavaScript to give us a better understanding of what it's capable of. The review really helped, and I was finally able to complete my assignment from the previous week. I'm still a little fuzzy on some of the concepts such as creating functions with arrays and looping structures, but I definitely have a grasp on all the basics. Below is an example of a new skill I learned and one of the exercises we did.</p>
  	<script>
function clearScreen(){
	var paragraphs = document.getElementsByName("generic");
	for(var x=0; x<paragraphs.length; x++){
		paragraphs[x].innerHTML="";
		document.getElementById("unique").innerHTML = "Screen Cleared";
	}	
	}
	</script>
	<br>
<h2> JavaScript Function Example </h2>
<p id="unique"> To clear the HTML page click the button below</p>
<p name="generic">Go ahead click the button</p>
<p name="generic">Goodbye.</p>
<p name="generic"> All of this text will disappear when the button is pressed. </p>
<button onclick="clearScreen()">Clear </button>

  		<h1> WEEK 4 - 10/18/14</h1>
  		<p>It's already week 4 of GET HIP, so far my whole experience at Gallup has been filled with lots of learning and I love it. I'm trying to soak in all the information I can. This week we focused on Javascript and its capabilities that allow the user to interact with an HTML webpage. Javascript is similar to Scratch in the sense that it's mathematical and requires certain types of functions. The obvious difference though is that Javascript is all written from scratch, rather than using preset blocks of code. It's more difficult than HTML and CSS, but it adds life to the webpage and gives it a purpose which really intrigues me to learn as much as I can about Javascript. Hopefully, now after learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and along with the future skills we are going to learn in the next sessions to come, I will be able to create a complete website. </p>

  	<div id="topStrength">
  		<h2> Futuristic </h2>
  		<p id="content3p">As of late I really can notice the futuristic strength inside of me. Based on the strengths finder assessment, Futuristic was my #1 strength. As strengths finder describes it, the futuristic strength can occur when the present proves too frustrating and the people around you are too pragmatic; you conjure up your visions of the future and they energize you. I find myself doing this a lot lately to push through with sports and all of my schoolwork, and i'd have to say, if I wasn't a futuristic/optimistic person I would not make it through mentally stable. I also have a drive to be successful, being futuristic helps me imagine the future that I want for myself, and also fuels the achiever inside of me to help reach my goals.</p>

  	<h1>WEEK 3 - 10/11/14</h1>
  	<p id="narrow"> Today in class Hannah taught us about HTML and CSS. Based on my own experience, I really enjoy HTML and CSS so coming into this weeks class I was pretty excited. The lesson that Hannah taught really helped reinforce everything I knew prior to the class, but it also taught me a lot as well. Specifically, I now know how to make tables through HTML and how to create div classes to organize my headers, paragraphs, pictures etc... Something that I was really happy to learn was the fixed position attribute, which sticks a header to the page and makes it stay there even while scrolling. Being able to make webpages is awesome to know, and for me is exciting to see my ideas come to life to be able to share them for everyone to see. Below is a little snippet of the bio website I made of Molly for our project. Her favorite colors are blue and purple so I tried to use and blend those colors as much as I could.  </p>

  	<h1> WEEK 2 - 10/4/14 </h1>
  	<p id="week2">In class this week we did more work in scratch and focused mainly on encryption and decryption. Encrypting and decrypting are ways to communicate with only certain people who know the key for the message you have written. The way that we used it in scratch was through the use of the alphabet. We simply asked the user to enter a message and we wrote a program that would encode the message with a specific shift in the alphabet (ex: a --> d and d-->g) then be able to decode the message and show our original message that was sent. For this project we worked in groups which was very enjoyable. I liked it because I was able to easily meet new people and I also got a little bit of an insight on how others think when programming to help myself when i'm working individually. On top of all we learned in scratch this week, it was equally as awesome to have the speaker come answer questions and talk to us about our ESF report. Learning about ourselves and our strengths from a business perspective is a different insight you don't usually get, I can tell i'm learning more about myself than I ever have before. </p>

  	<h1> WEEK 1 - 9/27/14 </h1>
  	<p>
  		Today was my first day in the Gallup high school GET HIP program, and already I have learned a lot. Specifically, we learned about scratch programming and the basics to create a program. Scratch has pre-made programming blocks that you put together to create lines of code to carry out specific tasks. At first I thought it would be very easy, but I now know that Scratch is just like regular coding in the sense that it acquires knowledge and precision. I've coded before in school and on my own, but it has always been for fun. I can already tell that GET HIP is going to expand my knowledge of programming by making me compete with others and completing tasks in a timely fashion. Week 1 was a lot of fun, I can't wait for the weeks to come!
