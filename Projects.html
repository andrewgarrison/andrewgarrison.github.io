    <p>Space Escape was created for a homework assignment at my high school internship class at Gallup. <br>
      I was able to create the game through the use of the programming interface known as Scratch.</p>

    <p>Yeah, okay so I know what you're thinking... "Only two projects? And one is just a lousy game?" My response to that is; i'm fairly new to coding and have been practicing on the actual craft of it with little exercises rather than diving right in and deveoping projects. <br>
      But hey! Lets look on the brightside and admire my first major project, this website right here that you are currently reading this on. All in all, this web project took me about 2 months to complete, and again this was an assignment for my high school internship class at Gallup. <br>
      From what you've seen on this website so far I hope that you've enjoyed it. Please send me a message at the contact page if you have any questions, compliments, etc. to say to me! Thank you for visiting.
